# Level 1: The Novice Hacker
On this level we will learn how to write a simple .C code and we will understand each part of it.

On the other side, we will also learn what is the CTF and we will solve a level from a CTF called *Bandit Over The Wire*. 

## Learning
### Security
1. What is CTF?
   
CTF stands for Capture The Flag, which is a type of cybersecurity competition where participants solve a variety of challenges to uncover "flags" (usually text strings or files) hidden within systems or applications. These challenges typically cover various aspects of cybersecurity, including cryptography, steganography, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, web exploitation, network analysis, and more.

To practice CTFs, there are several platforms and websites available:

**CTFTime:** This platform lists upcoming CTF events from around the world. It's a great place to find competitions to participate in and track your performance over time. You can visit their website at https://ctftime.org/.

**Hack The Box:** This platform offers a wide range of virtual machines and challenges designed to simulate real-world scenarios. Users can gain access to retired machines by solving challenges, which are divided into categories such as reversing, crypto, web, and more. Check it out at https://www.hackthebox.eu/.

**OverTheWire:** OverTheWire hosts various wargames focusing on different aspects of cybersecurity, such as basic Linux skills, cryptography, and more advanced topics like binary exploitation. These games are excellent for beginners and advanced users alike. Visit their website at https://overthewire.org/wargames/.

**picoCTF:** This is a beginner-friendly CTF hosted by Carnegie Mellon University, aimed at middle and high school students but suitable for beginners of all ages. It covers a wide range of topics and provides challenges with varying difficulty levels. You can access it at https://picoctf.org/.

**TryHackMe:** TryHackMe offers a platform for learning cybersecurity through interactive challenges and virtual machines. It covers various topics, including CTF-style challenges, and provides guided learning paths for beginners. Explore it at https://tryhackme.com/.

**VulnHub:** VulnHub provides downloadable virtual machines with intentionally vulnerable configurations, allowing users to practice their penetration testing skills in a safe environment. Users can solve challenges and gain root access to the machines. Visit their website at https://www.vulnhub.com/.

These platforms offer a wide range of challenges suitable for beginners to advanced users. Starting with beginner-friendly platforms like picoCTF and TryHackMe can help you build foundational skills before moving on to more advanced challenges on platforms like Hack The Box and CTFTime. Remember to take your time, document your progress, and learn from both your successes and failures.

2. Let's solve a level from [bandit over the wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/):
Bandit simplifies the learning of Linux command line by providing practical examples for each command. It allows you to integrate your newfound knowledge to solve laboratory exercises.
  - Download [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) first on order to connect to the Bandit labs.
  - Read the lab Note for beginners.
  - Now let's select Level 0 then SSH and accept the key for the Bandit server to begin the labs.

  - Enter the credentials that givin to you, ***bandit0*** for user and password too.

  - Now we are connected successfully to the server, and that's for level 0.
