#include <stdio.h>
//#include ⇒ preprocessor directive and we can tell that because it has # before it, and #include means take the contents of the file stdio.h and just copy and paste it where you see it.
//<stdio.h> ⇒ is library for standard input and output, This library provides functions like printf() and scanf() for input and output operations. it’s within the gcc compiler.
int main(void) {
  //int main(void) { ... }: This is the main function of your program. Every C program must have a main() function, and it serves as the entry point for execution. In this case, int specifies the return type of the function, which is an integer. 
  //The void keyword inside the parentheses means that the function main() takes no parameters. In other words, it indicates that the function doesn't expect any input arguments.
  printf("Hi my name is Dedsec\n");
  //printf to print output
  //\n for make a new line
  return 0;
  //The return 0; statement in the main() function serves a crucial purpose in C programs. Here's what it means:
  //1. **Exit Status**: In C (and many other programming languages), when a program finishes executing, it can return a value to the operating system. This value is known as the "exit status" and it typically indicates whether the program executed successfully or encountered an error.
  //2. **Successful Execution**: By convention, returning a value of 0 from the **`main()`** function indicates that the program executed successfully. This means that it completed all its tasks without encountering any errors.
  //3. **Error or Abnormal Termination**: If the **`main()`** function encounters an error or needs to terminate abnormally, it can return a non-zero value to indicate this. Conventionally, a non-zero return value signifies that the program encountered an error during execution.
